## Description

A social networking app built to let users find each other based on shared interest in certain skills, such as musical instruments or a particular programming language. It was created in Angular 2 using a Firebase database.

It features:

* User Authentication with Firebase
* The ability to search for users based on a skill or their location
* A Many-to-Many relationship between users and skills
* User profile page to display each user's username, email, occupation, photo and skills.
